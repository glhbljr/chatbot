## Usage

The AI's are designed to respond to natural language queries from users. You can ask them questions, or just have a casual conversation.

### Voice Messages

When dealing with voice messages, you have two options for transcription: utilizing the Whisper API or the local method. Each option has its own considerations, including cost and performance.

<details>
<summary><strong>Whisper API:</strong></summary>

   - **Cost:** Utilizing the Whisper API incurs a cost of US$0.06 per 10 minutes of audio.
   - **Setup:**
     1. Obtain an OpenAI API key and place it in the `.env` file under the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.
     2. Set `TRANSCRIPTION_ENABLED` to `"true"` and `TRANSCRIPTION_METHOD` to `"whisper-api"`. While setting a language in `TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE` is not mandatory, it is recommended for better performance.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Local Mode:</strong></summary>

   - **Cost:** The local method is free but may be slower and less precise.
   - **Setup:**
     1. Download a model of your choice from [here](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main). Download any `.bin` file and place it in the `./whisper/models` folder.
     2. Modify the `.env` file by changing `TRANSCRIPTION_ENABLED` to `"true"`, `TRANSCRIPTION_METHOD` to `"local"`, and `"TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL"` with the name of the model you downloaded.

### Group Chat

To utilize it in a group chat, you will need to either mention it by using her username with the "@" symbol (e.g., @Sydney) or reply directly to her last message.

### Available commands

- `!help`: Displays a message listing all available commands.
- `!help` followed by a specific command, e.g., `!help reset`: Provides detailed information about the selected command.
- If you wish to customize the command prefix, you can do so in the `.env` file to better suit your preferences.
